CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:32 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findhighway_env.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "highway_env", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "highway_env" with
  any of the following names:

    highway_envConfig.cmake
    highway_env-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "highway_env" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "highway_env_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "highway_env" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
